# UNSW-Challenge
Coding Test for UNSW Interview

## Questions
1. If you had more time, what would you change or focus more time on?
- If I had more time, I would probably change and improve the form and backend model to allow users to create multiple specific timeslots for participants to vote. At the moment, all available timeslots are hardcoded and can only be an hourly value between 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. and there is no option to create customizable timeslots. I'd also improve the creation form invitation UI to allow the user to invite participants without scrolling and manually ctrl + left click each participant to invite them.

2. Which part of the solution consumed the most amount of time?
- The solution that consumed the most amount of time definitely is designing and implementing the polling feature itself. This is because I had to think about the minimum requirements that I would need to implement the features requested for the polling system and how would I map them to each invididual participants. Once I had the design ready, it still took me a bit of time to do some testing around to fix up issues and limitations related to my design.

3. What would you suggest to the customer that they may not have thought of in regards to their request?
- There were a few things I would suggest to the customer that they may have not thought in regards to their request. For example, one of the things that wasn't mentioned by the customer is that how many times should a participant/user be allowed to vote a poll. For this challenge, I have implemented a solution to allow each user to vote at most once per poll to avoid vote manipulation. Another thing that the customer could consider is to specify what sort of timeslot they would like, for this challenge the timeslot used is an hourly timeslot therefore the poll creator is only able to create timeslots to vote in hours between 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. but there can also be timeslots such as a datetime timeslot where the creator could specify a date and the time available for each date.
